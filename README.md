# AI Math Visuals - Parametric Curves Gallery

A full-screen visualization gallery showcasing hundreds of dynamically animated parametric curves with interactive hover effects.

## Features

- **12+ Parametric Curve Types**: Lissajous, Spirograph, Lamé, Polynomial, Trigonometric Sums, Harmonograph, Rose, Epitrochoid, Hypotrochoid, Butterfly, Cardioid, and Cycloid curves
- **Dynamic Animation**: Continuously evolving curves with time-based parameter changes
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Hover over any curve to see its name and scaling effect
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Automatically adapts to screen size, displaying 100-500 curves
- **Real-time Color Changes**: Each curve type has its own color scheme that evolves over time

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the full-screen parametric curves gallery.

For local development:
```bash
# Start a local server

## Curve Types Included

1. **Lissajous Curves** - Beautiful sine wave combinations
2. **Spirograph Curves** - Classic rolling circle patterns  
3. **Lamé Curves** - Generalized elliptical shapes
4. **Polynomial Curves** - Mathematical polynomial visualizations
5. **Trigonometric Sums** - Multiple frequency combinations
6. **Harmonograph Curves** - Simulated pendulum patterns
7. **Rose Curves** - Flower-like polar equations
8. **Epitrochoids** - Curves traced by circles rolling outside other circles
9. **Hypotrochoids** - Curves traced by circles rolling inside other circles
10. **Butterfly Curves** - Transcendental mathematical curves
11. **Cardioids** - Heart-shaped curves
